What I Learned
Building Tech Horizons was more than just codingâ€”it was a deep dive into full-stack development and a hands-on experience with Laravel (PHP), MySQL, and a fully custom front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (without relying on frameworks like Bootstrap or jQuery).

Key Areas of Growth:
Back-end Development: Implemented secure authentication, role-based middleware, and dynamic CRUD operations.
Database Optimization: Structured and optimized databases for performance.
Front-end UI/UX: Designed and developed a custom, responsive interface without the use of UI frameworks.
This project has not only sharpened my technical skills but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities, pushing me outside of my comfort zone and deepening my love for web development and software engineering.
